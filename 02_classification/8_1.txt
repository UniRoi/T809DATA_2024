Question A:
The results are differnet sometimes the first dataset is more accurate 
and in another run the second one is better. This is because the dataset is 
very limited, only 50 datapoints and the mean and standard distributions are 
different.

Question B:
- Increasing the datapoints result in a higher and stable accuracy
because there is more training-data with a wider spread across the mean and standard distribution.
Decreasing the number is making the accuracy worse.
- Mean: Decreasing the mean, will result in less accuracy, because the values are wider spread
- Std. dev: Decreasing the std. dev. will result in higher accuracy, because values are now closer together 
This can lead to overfitting
